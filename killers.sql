They can be picked up and set down mostly anywhere. Traps are not armed until picked up and placed. The Trapper starts the game with a single trap in his hands, and can only carry one at a time unless using the Trapper Bag or Stitched Bag Add-ons.\r\n\r\nAfter pressing alternate attack, the Trapper bends down and sets the trap, looking directly downwards allowing nearby survivors to run around him unseen. If a survivor walks over an armed trap however, the trap will spring and catch one of their legs, where upon they will be trapped in place until either they manage to free themselves, a fellow survivor comes to free them, or the Trapper returns to hoist them onto his shoulder. A trapped survivor will make a lot of noise, alerting the Trapper, and be visible to the Trapper through walls. The traps also possess an aura that can be seen by the trapper at all times, and from all ranges. This is useful for identifying which traps have not yet been set as well as traps that have been disarmed. Should the Trapper walk within the hitbox of one of his traps, he will reach down to free himself, but the trap will remain in the set position and no effect is imbued upon the Killer.\r\n\r\nIt is very common for experienced Trappers to put Bear Traps in hard-to-identify locations such as tall grass, around a corner, or on one side of a window in order for survivors to trigger them without being previously alerted to their position.\r\n\r\n-Immobilises and injures trapped Survivors.\r\n\r\n-Starts match with 1 Bear Trap.\r\n5 Bear Traps are available randomly placed throughout the Map.\r\n\r\n-Sabotaged Bear Traps respawn after 3 minutes.', 'https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/deadbydaylight_gamepedia_en/thumb/2/20/FulliconPowers_trap.png/130px-FulliconPowers_trap.png?version=04e8dead23613e13c60698c5fbfb7019'),
